# GText Editor
The most simple text editor in the world! This project sin not fully done yet, but I plan to have may features, including an option to install plugins and a possibly syntax highlighting! Please support the developer through [his donate page](https://ramirorocha.com/donate)!
# What is it?
GText Editor is not yet done, but I am working *really* hard at getting it done. I have a pre-release on [the main repository](https://github.com/GTextEditor/GTextEditor/releases). If you are interested, please download it and tell me if you find any bugs or have any suggestions for features. You can contact me throught [my website](https://ramirorocha.com)!
# What does it have?
GText Editor(GTE) has an open feature, a new file feature, and a save feature. The reason for so few features is because I was just trying someting out at first, but then I thought 'What if I published this barley working version on the internet?' So I did! 
# Why GTE?
Because it's nice to help out a developer who really wants to put something in his resume.
