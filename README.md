# GText Editor
The most simple text editor in the world! This project sin not fully done yet, but I plan to have may features, including an option to install plugins and a possibly syntax highlighting! Please support the developer through [his donate page](https://ramirorocha.com/donate)!

# What is it?
GText Editor is not yet done, but I am working *really* hard at getting it done. I have a pre-release on [the main repository](https://github.com/GTextEditor/GTextEditor/releases). If you are interested, please download it and tell me if you find any bugs or have any suggestions for features. You can contact me throught [my website](https://ramirorocha.com)!

# What does it have?
GText Editor(GTE) has an open feature, a new file feature, and a save feature. The reason for so few features is because I was just trying someting out at first, but then I thought 'What if I published this barley working version on the internet?' So I did! 

# Why GTE?
Because it's nice to help out a developer who really wants to put something in his resume. 

# About
The point of GTE is makiing using a text editor simple and fast. I plan to make it fully portable(meaning it runs off a thumb drive or some other external storage device) and work out of the box on both linux and Windows(Win 10 is what I use for testing). I find that the most difficult part of using text editors like Notepad++ and atom is the long installation and having to configure it with a complicated GUI. I plan to make my GUI as user friendly as possible. No more menus that only a genius would understand. Second, the point of having it be portable is so that you don't have to worry about making changes to the installing in a manager that you only ever get to see once. We don't want people to have to download a software more than once.

# Plans for the future
## In order here are the features I plan to add:
1. 'Save As' function
2. Adding a little :x: on the tabs in  the editor
3. A better and more custom GUI

## In no specific order, here are the feature I might add:
* Syntax Highlighting
* An ability to install plugins made by the development team and ones made by the community
